</head>

<body>
    An institute is an organisational body created for a certain purpose. They are often research organisations
    (research institutes) created to do research on specific topics, or can also be a professional body.

    In some countries, institutes can be part of a university or other institutions of higher education, either as a
    group of departments or an autonomous educational institution without a traditional university status such as a
    "university institute" (see Institute of Technology). In some countries, such as South Korea and India, private
    schools are sometimes referred to as institutes, and in Spain, secondary schools are referred to as institutes.

    Historically, in some countries institutes were educational units imparting vocational training and often
    incorporating libraries, also known as mechanics' institutes.

    The word "institute" comes from a Latin word institutum meaning "facility" or "habit"; from instituere meaning
    "build", "create", "raise" or "educate".
